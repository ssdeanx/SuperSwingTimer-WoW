# Active Context

## Current focus

1. Swing timing precision, especially white-hit end timing, parry haste, and OH/MH reset correctness.
2. Keeping weave assist cast-driven while preserving ranged-channel behavior on the ranged bar.
3. Memory-bank persistence and production-ready planning notes.

## What we know right now

- The live feature plan in `memory-bank/weaveapi-swingtimer-ui` now covers the runtime addon, config/media UI, release docs, metadata, and diagnostics surface.
- The weave breakpoint uses the current cast window (cast remaining or cast time plus latency) while still being drawn on the MH bar canvas.
- The main-hand swing timer now refreshes latency in the active update loop, so end-of-swing timing stays closer to live network state.
- Parry haste now scales from the player's current melee haste (`GetMeleeHaste()` / `GetHaste()` fallback) instead of a flat reduction.
- A new WoW Classic Lua skill now exists at `.github/skills/wow-classic-lua` for loading at the start of future sessions.
- White-hit handling still stays split by hand, and ranged reset spells keep their own path.
- The overlay keeps the breakpoint triangles visible while the MH timer is active; the spark remains cast-only.
- The weave spark tracks cast progress instead of swing progress.
- Texture selection in the config panel uses a dropdown list of SharedMedia/Blizzard entries with category labels instead of a browser window.
- Targeted diagnostics on the edited runtime files are clean.

## Likely bug area

- `SuperSwingTimer_State.lua` for white-hit timing, parry haste, and clean CLEU handling.
- `SetupEnhShaman()` / `UpdateWeaveVisuals()` in `SuperSwingTimer_ClassMods.lua` for breakpoint placement.

## Working assumptions

- The cast window is the breakpoint source; the MH bar is just the visual surface the breakpoint is drawn onto.
- The triangle markers represent the safe cast threshold based on cast remaining / cast time and latency.
- The spark remains tied to cast progress while the breakpoint markers stay visible whenever weave assist is enabled and the MH timer is active.

## Next steps

- Keep the state engine lean by removing any leftover unused CLEU unpacking when it appears.
- Preserve the SharedMedia dropdown, cast-spark behavior, and ranged-channel handling as the current working state.
