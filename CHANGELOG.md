# Super Swing Timer Changelog

## 3.1.1 - 2026-04-23

- Added a latency-aware hunter Auto Shot red-zone marker so the cast window shows up before the bar turns red.
- Added a dedicated ranged bar texture selector so Hunters can skin Auto Shot separately from MH / OH.
- Switched Hunter Auto Shot timing to use the Auto Shot cooldown API when active, anchoring the ranged bar to the cooldown start and falling back to `UnitRangedDamage()` when needed.
- Widened the `/sst` panel and clarified the MH / OH, ranged, and weave breakpoint appearance sections.
- Reflowed the `/sst` rows so labels sit above the controls and the texture, cycle, toggle, and color rows are easier to click.
- Hardened the paladin seal breakpoint lookup so it prefers aura names, uses verified seal IDs, and still works when a rank ID is missing.
- Expanded the paladin seal family table to match `docs/spellIds.md` for Command, Corruption, Blood, Martyr, Vengeance, Justice, Wisdom, Righteousness, Light, and Crusader.
- Made the ret paladin seal-twist indicator into a UnitAura-aware breakpoint line that switches between the end-of-swing twist point and the earlier reseal point, and defaults to an opaque black marker.

## 3.1.0 - 2026-04-23

- Added Blizzard Interface Options / AddOns registration so the config panel is available in-game without slash commands.
- Switched the primary slash aliases to `/sst`, `/super`, and `/superswingtimer`, and removed the `/swangthang` alias.
- Made the default MH / OH / ranged bar colors follow the player class color until you choose custom swatches.
- Added an indicator glow mode toggle so weave and spark markers can use either a bright glow or a more opaque blend.
- Reworked the texture dropdown to show actual texture previews alongside the texture names.
- Widened and re-labeled the `/sst` UI into clearer bar, weave, and color groups.

## 3.0.1 - 2026-04-23

- Added color-coded weave-family toggles for Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Healing Wave, Lesser Healing Wave, and Chain Heal.
- Made the weave marker pair smaller and clarified the upper/lower marker labels in `/sst`.
- Widened the `/sst` panel and added clearer weave-assist descriptions and spacing.

## 3.0.0 - 2026-04-21

- Rebranded SwangThang to Super Swing Timer.
